        <b>TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP</b>
        An experienced leader in the global/public health arena, I am skilled at
        conceptualizing the vision for international health and development
        programs, driving strategic direction, defining deliverables, aligning
        resources, and leading programs to successful completion every time.

        A dedicated Medical Epidemiologist, I believe in evidence based
        programing strengthened by my ardent participation in operations
        research over the course of my carrier and authored a number of peer
        reviewed research publications.

        I have deep concern and expertise in all global health concerns and have
        spent 27 years primarily working with and managing HIV/AIDS prevention,
        care, and treatment programs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

      <p>
        As a program director and health systems strengthening expert, I
        understand public health program management and implementation. I have
        additional experience in national health commodity supply chain systems
        with a long and successful track record building and improving national
        supply chains in Sub-Saharan Africa. I have served as an advisor to
        government ministries and NGOs and fully understand the complex business
        challenges of startups, turnarounds, and organizational restructurings.
      </p>

    <div class="box yellow show">
      <p>
        My ability to facilitate partnerships and manage collaborations with
        global organizations (PEPFAR, USAID, CDC, US DOD, Global Fund/UNDP,
        UNFPA, DFID and others) has resulted in countless program successes and
        helped improve the lives of many persons throughout Africa.

      <p>
        Over the course of my career I have served as a Medical Officer, Medical
        Epidemiologist, Project Leader, Research Director, and Program/Country
        Director. I am known for my turnaround capabilities. I have leaned on my
        single-most important core belief to drive program success: “I believe
        that nothing is impossible and, once in, I never quit.”
